# Feature Specification: 3D Endless Runner Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-3d-endless-runner`
**Created**: 2026-03-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "3D endless runner game where player can move left, right, up, and down"

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-03-16

- Q: How should the game handle when multiple directional inputs are pressed at the same time? → A: First-input-wins (whichever key was pressed first is the only one that registers)
- Q: What obstacle types should the game support and which movement directions are meaningful for avoiding them? → A: Lane-based obstacles (discrete lanes, left/right switches, up/down for jump/duck)
- Q: What game states should exist and how does the player transition between them? → A: Full states: Start Screen → Running → Paused → Game Over → Restart
- Q: How many discrete lanes should the game have? → A: 3 lanes (left, center, right) - standard, easy to parse visually
- Q: How should obstacle patterns and game difficulty evolve during a run? → A: Progressive scaling (speed and obstacle density increase gradually over time/distance)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Player Movement Control (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want to control my character's movement in four directions (left, right, up, down) across discrete lanes so that I can navigate through the game environment and avoid obstacles.

**Why this priority**: This is the core mechanic of the game. Without player movement control, there is no gameplay. This forms the foundation upon which all other game mechanics are built.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by spawning the player in a test environment with no obstacles and verifying that pressing movement controls moves the character to the correct lane or triggers the correct vertical action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the player character is running forward automatically in the center lane, **When** the player presses the left movement control, **Then** the character moves to the left lane
2. **Given** the player character is running forward automatically in the left lane, **When** the player presses the right movement control, **Then** the character moves to the center lane
3. **Given** the player character is running forward automatically in the center lane, **When** the player presses the right movement control, **Then** the character moves to the right lane
4. **Given** the player character is running forward automatically in the right lane, **When** the player presses the left movement control, **Then** the character moves to the center lane
5. **Given** the player character is running forward automatically, **When** the player presses the up movement control, **Then** the character performs a jump action
6. **Given** the player character is running forward automatically, **When** the player presses the down movement control, **Then** the character performs a duck/slide action
7. **Given** the player is in the left lane, **When** the player presses left, **Then** the character remains in the left lane (no movement)
8. **Given** the player is in the right lane, **When** the player presses right, **Then** the character remains in the right lane (no movement)

### User Story 2 - Endless Running Progression (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want my character to automatically run forward continuously through an ever-changing environment so that I experience an endless runner gameplay loop.

**Why this priority**: This defines the "endless runner" genre. The automatic forward movement creates the core tension and pacing of the game, requiring players to react to incoming obstacles.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting the game with no user input and observing that the character continuously moves forward through generated terrain/obstacles until a game over condition is met.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the game has started, **When** no user input is provided, **Then** the character continues running forward automatically
2. **Given** the character is running, **When** time passes, **Then** new obstacles and environment elements appear ahead of the player
3. **Given** the character is running, **When** the player successfully avoids obstacles, **Then** the game continues indefinitely

### User Story 3 - Obstacle Collision and Game Over (Priority: P3)

As a player, I want the game to detect when my character collides with obstacles and end the run so that there is a failure condition and challenge to the gameplay.

**Why this priority**: Without collision detection and game over conditions, there is no challenge or end state to the game. This creates the risk/reward dynamic essential to endless runners.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally colliding the player with an obstacle and verifying that the game detects the collision and triggers the game over state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the player is running forward, **When** the player collides with an obstacle, **Then** the game detects the collision and ends the current run
2. **Given** the player successfully avoids all obstacles, **When** the player continues running, **Then** the game continues without ending
3. **Given** the game has ended due to collision, **When** the player restarts, **Then** a new run begins with the score reset

---

### User Story 4 - Game State Management (Priority: P4)

As a player, I want the game to have clear states (start screen, running, paused, game over) with smooth transitions so that I can understand the game status and control my play session.

**Why this priority**: Clear state management provides player feedback and control over the experience. Pause functionality is expected in modern games, and start/game over screens provide necessary context and score display.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by transitioning through each state (start → running → paused → running → game over → restart) and verifying the correct UI and behavior for each state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the game application has loaded, **When** no action is taken, **Then** the start screen is displayed with game title and start option
2. **Given** the start screen is displayed, **When** the player initiates a new game, **Then** the game transitions to the running state
3. **Given** the game is running, **When** the player activates pause, **Then** the game transitions to paused state and freezes all game action
4. **Given** the game is paused, **When** the player activates resume, **Then** the game transitions back to running state from the exact point of pause
5. **Given** the game is running, **When** the player collides with an obstacle, **Then** the game transitions to game over state and displays the final score
6. **Given** the game over state is displayed, **When** the player initiates restart, **Then** a new game session begins with score reset to zero

### Edge Cases

- When the player presses multiple movement controls simultaneously, the system MUST register only the first input received and ignore subsequent inputs until the first is released
- How does the system handle rapid successive inputs (e.g., pressing left-right-left within 0.5 seconds)?
- What happens when the player is jumping and presses up again before landing?
- What happens when the player is ducking and presses down again before standing?
- How does the system handle movement input during the collision detection frame?
- What happens if an obstacle spawns in a position that is impossible to avoid given current player position?
- How does the system handle lane transitions when the player is mid-switch between lanes?

## Requirements

- **FR-016**: System MUST allow the player to pause the game during the running state
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow the player to resume the game from the paused state, continuing from the exact point of pause

- **FR-019**: System MUST gradually increase the forward movement speed as the run duration increases

### Key Entities

- **Player Character**: The controllable entity that occupies one lane at a time and can perform jump/duck actions
- **Lane**: One of exactly 3 discrete horizontal positions (left, center, right) where the player and obstacles can be positioned
- **Obstacle**: Environmental hazards positioned in specific lanes that require lane-switching, jumping, or ducking to avoid; triggers game over upon collision
